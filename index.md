Finally my official first ever piece of text written over internet, and it's bewildering to think about the amount of time I have spent finding the right time, place, and resources to get started. I always had so much to tell, possibly because of wide range of experiences i have had due to my sharp observation and over-thinking skills :) .I believe this to be the reason for me to have a unique perspective on almost all the problems I have faced in life till now. The only question that had stopped me from shatring my views till now is: **What Value Could I Add?**

I felt that almost everything that I can share is out there already, but slowly I have realized that the value lies not only in the content but also the perspective it brings in. This finally convinced me to start writing.

Although I am a trained engineer, I have a special fondness for thinking about life, people, and their problems from philosophical and psychological angles.

Thanks for visiting. Keep smiling :)
