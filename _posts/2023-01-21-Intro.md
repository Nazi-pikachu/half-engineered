This is perhaps my first ever piece of text written officially over the internet, and it's bewildering to think about the amount of time I have spent finding the right time, place, and resources to get started. I always had so much to tell, perhaps because I had such a range of experiences. Coupled with my sharp observation and thinking skills, it forced me to have a unique take on almost all the problems I have faced in life till now. The only question that have always stopped me from starting writing is: **What Value Could I Add?**

I felt that almost everything that I can share is out there already, but slowly I have realized that the value lies not only in the content but also the perspective it brings in. This convinced me to start writing.

Although I am a trained engineer, I have a special fondness for thinking about life, people, and their problems from philosophical and psychological angles.

See you soon. Keep smiling :)
