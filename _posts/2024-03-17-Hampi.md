**Hampi** was the capital city of erstwhile **Vijayanagar Empire**, one the most prosperous empire of its time. However, in a sudden turn of events the empire got defeated by **Deccan sultanate**, bringing an end to glorious period of Vijaynagara empire.

 If this much historical importance isn't sufficient for you to visit this place.
This place also finds it's mention in Hindu mythology Ramayana as the famous monkey kingdom of **Kishkinda** , where **Lord Rama** meet **Hanuman Ji** in his quest to search for **Sita Maa**.

Admittedly I didn't know all this about the place when I first decided to visit it. I just wanted to do a **Solo-trip** to prove myself that I am capable of one! I shortlisted it based on the advice of one of my relative due to my fondness for arts and culture. In the spur of the moment, I booked the tickets from **Bangalore to Hosapete** (nearest railway Jn to Hampi) with one of my office friend tagged along me. With Just one way ticket and **dorm bed** for 2 days I reached there on 14th Jan.

As I now introspect why is that I wanted to do a Solo-trip, why not do it with friends? I realise that there is a personal growth involved with travelling alone. Imagine a kid who never even went to school alone wanted to visit a new city in an entirely new state with a different language and cuisine. If I have to list the benefits of travelling alone, **building confidence** and **developing presence of mind** will be top among them and as most of you will agree these characteristics are indeed crucial for daily life and if I may say somewhat seductive as well.

Now for all those who got pumped up and wanted to visit this Rome of East here is my itinerary along with tips that you can follow.
### Day 1
 - Archeological temple
- Elephant Stables
- **Lotus Mahal**
- Royal Palace
- Queen's Bath

### Day 2

- Hampi bazaar (souvenir)

### Day 3

I have bolded the highlights of each day which i absolutely loved and will recommend you all to must visit.
- How I reached there?
Since I was travelling from Bangalore, and this was supposed to be a budget backpacking trip I booked a 3AC from Bangalore to Hosapete. Hampi is roughly 15 Km from Hosapete and you can find plently of Autos just outside the railway station to leave you there or like me you can walk for around 1Km to nearest Bus station and took a bus to Hampi.
- Where to Stay
Hampi main site doesn't have any accomodation facilities instead you have either stay in Hosapete or if you can adjust , there are modest accomodation options available at near town of Kamalpur from where Hampi is just 5 Km

- Budget?
