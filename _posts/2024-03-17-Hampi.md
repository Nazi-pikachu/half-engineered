**Hampi** was the capital city of erstwhile **Vijayanagar Empire**, one the most prosperous empire of its time. However, in a sudden turn of events the empire got defeated by **Deccan sultanate**, bringing an end to glorious period of Vijaynagara empire.

 If this much historical importance isn't sufficient for you to visit this place.
This place also finds it's mention in Hindu mythology Ramayana as the famous monkey kingdom of **Kishkinda** , where **Lord Rama** meet **Hanuman Ji** in his quest to search for **Sita Maa**.

Admittedly I didn't know all this about the place when I first decided to visit it. I just wanted to do a **Solo-trip** to prove myself that I am capable of one! I shortlisted it based on the advice of one of my relative due to my fondness for arts and culture. In the spur of the moment, I booked the tickets from **Bangalore to Hosapete** (nearest railway Jn to Hampi) with one of my office friend tagged along me. With Just one way ticket and **dorm bed** for 2 days I reached there on 14th Jan.

As I now introspect why is that I wanted to do a Solo-trip, why not do it with friends? I realise that there is a personal growth involved with travelling alone. Imagine a kid who never even went to school alone wanted to visit a new city in an entirely new state with a different language and cuisine. If I have to list the benefits of travelling alone, **building confidence** and **developing presence of mind** will be top among them and as most of you will agree these characteristics are indeed crucial for daily life and if I may say somewhat seductive as well.

Now for all those who got pumped up and wanted to visit this Rome of East here is my itinerary along with tips that you can follow.
### Day 1
 - Archeological temple
- Elephant Stables
- **Lotus Mahal**
- Royal Palace
- Queen's Bath
- **Mantanga Hill** (SUNSET)

### Day 2

 - **Virupaksha Temple** (aarti)
- Hampi bazaar (souvenir)
- **Krishna temple** (yali & picturesque)
- Lakshmi Narsimha temple
- Kampa Bhupa trek
- **Vittala temple** (Stone chariot)
- **HEMKUNTA HILL (sunset)**

### Day 3

 - Sanapur Lake
- **Anjaneya Hill (Lord Hanuman birthplace)**

I have bolded the highlights of each day which i absolutely loved and will recommend you all to must visit.
### How I reached there?
Since I was travelling from Bangalore, and this was supposed to be a budget backpacking trip I booked a 3AC from Bangalore to Hosapete. Hampi is roughly 15 Km from Hosapete and you can find plenty of Autos just outside the railway station to leave you there or like me you can walk for around 1Km to nearest Bus station and took a bus to Hampi.
### Where I Stayed
Hampi main site doesn't have any accommodation facilities instead you have to either stay in Hosapete or if you can adjust, there are plenty modest accommodation options available at a nearby town of Kamalapur from where Hampi is just 5KM!
Since I was okay with modest accommodation and wanted to explore this place as a local i choose to stay near to Hampi in Kamalapur only at one of KSDTC Hotel (https://www.kstdc.co/hotels/hotel-mayura-bhuvaneshwari-hampi/).
### What I ate?
Now here things got interesting because I am veggie and have limited knowledge of South Indian Food. All I know is Dosa , idlli's and Vada that too because I had a friend in college who is from South India. Moreover, I am open to trying new dishes and appreciate the food in general, so I sailed through it, but my office friend struggled and at a point got frustrated with Dosa's ;)! For people who have reservation with foods, I would suggest picking up Hosapete as you base since there are plenty of options in the city.
### Budget?
Honestly i didn't had a number in my mind when I decided for Hampi but back of the mind i wanted to complete this trip in as low cost as possible so that after this one. I don;t have an excuse of moeny as a factor for cancelling trips:)
This trip of 2N and 3D costed me approx 5K including everything.
I saved on accommodation since i compromised and stayed in dorm whereas over expensed on train (booked 3AC in tatkal)
