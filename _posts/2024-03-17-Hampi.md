Hampi was the capital city of erstwhile Vijayanagar Empire, one the most prosperous empire of its time. However, in a sudden turn of events the empire got defeated by Deccan sultanate, bringing an end to glorious period of Vijaynagara empire.
 If this much historical importance isn't sufficient for you to visit this place.
This place also finds it's mention in Hindu mythology Ramayana as the famous monkey kingdom of Kishkinda , where Lord Rama meet Hanuman Ji in his quest to search for Sita Maa.
Admittedly I didn't know all this about this place when I first decided to visit it. I wanted to do a Solo-trip.
