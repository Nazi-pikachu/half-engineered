This is my first time living alone away from family, although I had earlier stayed without parents whether it was during JEE preparation or while studying at IITBHU, but it never felt different like I was living alone. So, what exactly changed now? Is that I have to manage most of my stuff own my own? No since it used to be the case in college as well. So what is it then? As i force myself to think i can realize that both while preparing for JEE or while studying at IIT at the back of my mind i was always at home i always took my stay as a short stint which will over and i will be back to status quo.
Un fortunately this is not the case any longer. There is this realisation that Saharanpur is now a place where i will be a mere visitor
