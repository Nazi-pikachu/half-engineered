This is my first time living alone away from family, although I had earlier stayed without parents whether it was during JEE preparation or while studying at IITBHU, but it never felt different like I was living alone. So what exactly changed now? Is that I have to manage most of my stuff own my own? No since it used to be the case in college as well. So is it that?
